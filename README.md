## Usage
- In order to use this site at the moment you'll need to host an audio file on a storage based cloud platform, a working example would be JukeHost

- [JukeHost tutorial](https://gist.github.com/Moutard3/b925b090ab1d6d20a5d20f054bae7bca#mp3-direct-link-hosting)

- After uploading the file and selecting the link to the audio, you can paste that in the import link input box on the dialog box that appears when the Transcribe Button is clicked.

- A transcripted file of the audio would be downloaded and VOILA, that's it.
